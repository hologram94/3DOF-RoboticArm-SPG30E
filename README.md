###### 3DOF-RoboticArm-SPG30E


### STL Files
The stl files are ready to print and assembled. Print settings can be found at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4065790

### Prerequisite (software)
1. Install the Arduino PID library included in the repository

### Prerequisite (hardware)
1. Arduino Mega
2. 12V DC power supply
3. Jumper wires
4. Printed parts
5. 3 Pin Male adapter
6. M3 screws (6 for each motor)
7. SG90 Servo motor
8. Any gripper design from thingiverse.

### Single Motor PID Coding
1. Please refer the coding for the connection of the SPG30E,motor driver and arduino.
2. Adjust the PPR accordingly to your type of SPG30E-xxxk
	for example, on cytron webpage, the ppr is 600 for 90degree, so a full 360 is 2400.
